## Important deadlines

Start signing up as a team with your project proposal. To do so, fill out this form (LINK will follow) before October 12 
In the tutorial in week 44 you will get feedback on your proposals. 

## Final project structure

*	Introduction: Describe the business problem you are trying to solve. What is it that your organization can do better/should do differently/doesn't understand. What is your motivation starting this project.
*	Literature review: a brief (one/two paragraphs) discussion around the issue you are trying to tackle. Because this is a course across lines and we expect groups to be heterogenous, we don't expect you to use too much space here. We encourage you to use this space wisely though: what do you know from other research about the problem you are trying to look into? What can you learn from previous approaches about e.g. variables, mechanisms that generate the data, analyses etc.
*	Research Question (s): What questions are you trying to answer? Did these questions change throughout the project? What prompted that change?
*	Description of data (source, variables, variable types etc)
*	Analysis: What visualizations did you consider? What are the different statistical methods you considered? Which ones did you end up adding to the report and why are those informative?
*	Discussion: What did you learn about the data? How did you answer the questions? How can you justify your answers? 
*	Code: you are required to submit your project as an RMarkdown file, which includes reflections (Sections 1 to 4), code (Section 5) and code comments. You are expected to submit code that embodies the reproducibility principles and therefore kindly make sure your analysis is properly documented.
