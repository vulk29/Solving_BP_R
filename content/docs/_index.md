**How to use this repository**
* The different sections give you access to material you can go through at your own pace that supplements/complements the exercises done in the tutorials. As a rule, this material _will not_  be tackled in the tutorials. Wherever necessary, I will point you to the sections you should consider if you need to clarify some topics we cover in the tutorials. Furthermore, once you will start working on your assignments you will likely discover there is a lot you don't know. This repository should be the first place you look :)
* For each chapter I have added the Learning Objectives: what you should be able to do. 
* There is also (for most chapters) a session with 'Further readings/resources'. If you don't find the answer in the given chapter, those resource will certainly have it.
