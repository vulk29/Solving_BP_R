There is a plethora of resources online that explain the basics well. See also the Part II in the Hands on programming book.
  
Alternatively, see [Chapter 4](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html) in the book by one of R's creators Hadley Wickham called "R for Data Science". Bear in mind that Wickham starts his book off with data visualisation, hence the exercise portion assumes that prerequisite. 
  
If you're a viewer, the accessible option is a video by "How to R" which covers all the basics like using R as a calculator, assigning values and types of objects well, if slightly superficially. It is accessible, inviting and short.

For the student that wants to go deeper, I recommend a video from Berkeley's R bootcamp. It covers the same bases as the video above, but expands on them greatly. Contrary to the one above, it includes conceptual commentary, being a part of a lecture. What is particularly beneficial is that it does not brush over vectors and is very thorough with data structures. Unsurprisingly, it is also nearly three times the length of the previous one.
