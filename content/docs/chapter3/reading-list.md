The Grolemund book goes into a lot of detail with _tidy_ and explains it properly. It is a lot to take in when you first start working with R, but as/if your projects become more complex you will find yourselves spending more and more time organizing your data. 

If you want to get a bit more practice with these tools, here is a tutorial from our friends at Software carpentry: http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/14-tidyr/index.html 

For more advanced stuff, this is a great resource: https://robchavez.github.io/datascience_gallery/html_only/data_wrangling.html
