**How to use this repository**
* The different sections give you access to the exercise in the tutorials. Solutions will be uploaded AFTER l you can go through at your own pace that supplements/complements the exercises done in the tutorials.
* For each session you have the Learning Objectives: what you should be able to do and some exercises: that allow you to test yourself against the learning objectives.
* There is also (for most chapters) a session with 'Further readings/resources'. That is entirely optional and is dedicated to those of you who want to push themselves a little bit more.
