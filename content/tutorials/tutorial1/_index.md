## Basic programming in R
1. Watch the tutorial video(s) available on BB. If you are not familiar with programing, they should give you a high level understanding of what is about to happen. 
2. Complete the "Basic building Blocks" section from the _swirl_ tutorial on programing basics in R. 

You can start it by installing the package, calling it and finally launching _swirl_. See the code below. (You can paste it directly into your console!) Once you launch, choose the R Programming course and start with "Basic Building Blocks".
```
install.packages("swirl") # install, you only need to do this once
library(swirl) # call
swirl() # launch
```
(aside for the Basic Building Blocks there are a lot of cool tutorials tehre, but for our course, you don't need to worry about them just yet)
3. Once you are done, click on this link (LINK) and fill in the survey. 
4. Join in on zoom on Thursday Sept 10 at 10.00. Zoom link is on Blackboard.
