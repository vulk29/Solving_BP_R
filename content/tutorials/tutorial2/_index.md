## Basic R (part2)
In this tutorial you will learn how to load data into R, basic R data structures as well as how to perform simple operations on a dataset, such as ploting a graph.
Note: these tutorials are part of a longer course. As usual, I encourage you to check it all out, but make sure you get the basics done first!
