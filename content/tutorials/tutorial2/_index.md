## Basic R (part2)

* 1. Watch the tutorial video(s) available on BB. In this tutorial you will learn how to load data into R, basic R data structures as well as how to perform simple operations on a dataset, such as ploting a graph.
* 2. Exercises
A. Complete Modules 1 and 2 from "A (very) short introduction to R". You first need to install it using the code below. Thereafter remember to load swirl and launch it. Then go through the two Modules at your leasure. Module 1 is a bit of a recap (but has slightly more challenging exercises). 
```
swirl::install_course("A_(very)_short_introduction_to_R") 
library('swirl')
swirl()
```
B. You are on a roll! Now, complete the tutorial from Sofware carpentry. 
Start here by downloading the files 
http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/setup.html

You find the tutorial here: http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/01-starting-with-data/index.html

NB. You dont learn how to do data science by reading. Write in the code yourselves. Run it. Fix it, if there are bugs. Modify it. 

* 3. Once you are done, click on this link (LINK) and fill in the survey. 
* 4. Join in on zoom on Friday Sept 18 at 12.00. Zoom link is on Blackboard.
